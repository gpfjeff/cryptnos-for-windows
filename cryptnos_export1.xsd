	Cryptnos Common Parameter Export Format
	Version 1
	Jeffrey T. Darlington
	April 27, 2010
	
	This XML schema defines the common site parameter export format to be used
	by all future versions of the Cryptnos password generating program.
	Previously, each platform had its own export format, which was sufficent
	for backing up data for that platform or moving from one instance of the
	program on that platform to another.  But it didn't really help when it came
	to copying data from one platform to another.  This common export format is
	meant to rectify that issue, giving a common XML-based parameter format that
	all platforms should use going forward.  Support for each original platform-
	specific format should be maintained for backward compatibility, but all
	versions should use this format going forward.
	
	Note that this XML file will likely be encrypted and possibly compressed;
	it should never be used completely unencrypted except for testing purposes.
	Encryption will be maditory, using a password-based AES-256 algorithm.
	Compression is still on the drawing board and may or may not be used; if
	used, the XML will be compressed before encryption and decompressed after
	decryption.  The current plan is to include compression so long as it does
	not significantly impact performance on all platforms.
	
	Required elements will include the version number of this format (which for
	now will be hard-coded to "1") and a <sites> element that will include a
	list of individual <site> entries.  Each <site> will include all the
	parameters required to recreate the user's generated password, with the
	exception of the master password which is never saved.  An optional but
	recommended <generator> attribute should include the name of the application
	that created the file including its user-readable version number.  An
	optional <comment> field is also allowed, but for now will be ignored since
	these files should never be human readable.

	<!-- Define the individual site parameter definition.  A set of parameters
	     consists primarily of a site token string (often a domain name but it
		 can be literally any unique string), a string representing the crypto-
		 graphic hash to use to generate the password, a positive integer
		 greater than zero specifying the number of hash iterations, an integer
		 that specifies the character type class (all characters, only alpha-
		 numerics, etc.), and a positive integer greater than or equal to zero
		 that represents the limit on the number of characters returned.  If the
		 character limit is zero, it is assumed that there is no limit imposed.
		 The number of hash iterations is actuall 1 <= x <= 500; the upper limit
		 is imposed due to performance issues on Google Android.  There will be
		 only one of each parameter per site block, so this should be a fairly
		 simple definition. -->
